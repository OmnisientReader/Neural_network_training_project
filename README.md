It is my training project in which I tried to use some basics to create a real workink neural network
I have not used any specialized libraries or frameworks to create it, except numpy for quick math's operating
and some standart libs for interacting with file system.

It has its drawbacks and in fact, there are quite a lot of them, but my ultimate goal was to create a network from scratch
and it works
